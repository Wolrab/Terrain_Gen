Overall:
glew, freeglut (i.e. glut), OpenGL (3.30?), glm

Temporal Dependance:
glut: Nothing
glew: glut must have created an OpenGL context
cube: glew must have been initialized. The first created cube binds and buffers data.
    Alternatives!
        -Some function that waits for an asynchronous global flag
        -"JuSt InItIaLiZe It WiTh SoMe OtHeR fUnCtIoN," like a normal human
        -^ I second this because this project is gonna suck anyways.
        -^^ No! I disagree! There is nothing about the current design of the object to make this not horrible to look at!
        -^^^ Ok... What about some like, global array of shit to be loaded in?
        -^^^^ This implies larger scope. So yeah do what you're already doing

    It has been decided no alternatives are needed. Hooray.
