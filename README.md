# Terrain_Gen
Soon: 3D terrain generation

For now: Slowly implementing generic 3D graphics features. The terrain will come once the camera is finally implemented.

So far, this project has been a great opportunity for learning C++, OpenGL, and more advanced design patterns for large scale projects.
